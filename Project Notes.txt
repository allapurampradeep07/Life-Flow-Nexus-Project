6.TECHNOLOGY DESCRIPTION
========================
JAVA:
=====
What is JAVA?
-------------
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation). It was first released in 1995. Java is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that programs written in Java can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system.
Modules used in Project :
-------------------------
Task Class :-
This class could include attributes such as task name, description, due date, status (completed or pending), etc. 
Task Manager Class :-
This class would handle operations like adding tasks, removing tasks, marking tasks as completed, updating task details, sorting tasks based on different criteria (e.g., due date), filtering tasks, etc.
User Interface:-
Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the to-do list application. You can use libraries like Java FX or Swing to create the UI components such as buttons, text fields, lists, etc. The UI should allow users to view their tasks, add new tasks, edit existing tasks, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and perform other relevant actions.
File I/O Module :-
Implement functionality to read and write tasks to a file. This allows users to save their tasks to disk and load them back when the application restarts. You can use Java's built-in File I/O classes or libraries like G son or Jackson for handling JSON serialization/d serialization.

HTML:-
======
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language .It is used to design web pages using the markup language.HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup Language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and markup language defines the text document within the tag that define the structure of web pages. It provides a set predefined tags and elements that define the different components and elements within a web-page. Here are some key aspects of HTML:
o Structure:- HTML is primary focused on defining the structure of a web page. It uses a Tree-like structure of nested tags to defined elements and their relationships.
o Tags and Elements:- HTML tags are used to enclosed and defined the structure of a web page. Tags are written within angle brackets(<>).Some common on HTML tags Include <h1> for headings, <p> for paragraphs, <a> for hyperlinks, for images, and<div> for divisions or sections. These tags, along with their attributes, help define the content and presentation of a web-page. 
o Attributes:- HTML tags can have attributes that provide addition information or modify their behavior. Attributes are written the opening tags and provide values within double Quotes(“). For Example, the<a> tag can have an attribute that specifies the URL to link to.
o Text Formatting: HTML allows for basic text formatting using tags such as <b> for Bold, <i> for italic, <u> for underlined, and <s> for strike through. Additionally, heading tags 
(<h1> to <h6>) represent different levels of headings, and paragraph tags (<p>) are Used for normal content.
o Links and Navigation:- HTML provides the <a> tag for creating hyperlinks. The href attributes specifies the URL to link to, and link text is placed between the opening and closing <a>tags. This allows users to navigate between web pages or different sections within a page.
o List:- HTML supports ordered lists(<ol>) and unordered lists (<ul>). List items are defined Using the <li> tag. Ordered lists display items with numbers or other ordered markets, while Unordered lists use bullet points. 
o Sematic Markup:- HTML5 introduced sematic elements such as <header>, <nar>, <article>, <section>, <footer>, and others. These tags provide more meaningful structure and help in improving accessibility and search engine optimization(SEO)
Advantages of HTML:
------------------- 
 It is easy to learn
 Every Browser supports HTML language.
 HTML is light weighted and fast to load
 Storage of big files are allowed because of the application cache feature.
 Do not get to purchase any extra software because it’s by default in every window.
 Loose syntax
 HTML is simple to edit as being a plain text.
 It integrates easily with other languages such as java Script, CSS etc.
 HTML is that it is easy to code even for novice programmers.
 It is fast to download as the text is compressible
 HTML has many tag and attributes which can short your line of code.

Cascading style sheets (CSS):
============================= 
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML, etc.). It defines how HTML elements should be displayed on screen, in print, or spoken aloud.Here are some key aspects and features of CSS:
1. Selectors:- CSS allows you to target HTML elements using selectors. Selectors can target elements based on their type, class, ID, attributes, and relationship with other elements.
2. Properties and Values:- CSS properties define the visual appearance of HTML elements, such as color, font, size, margin, padding, and more. Each property has one or more values associated with it, which determine how the property is applied.
3. Cascading:- CSS follows a cascading model, where multiple style sheets can be applied to the same document. Styles are applied in a specific order of precedence, allowing for inheritance, overriding, and specificity.
4. Inheritance:- CSS properties can be inherited from parent elements to their children. This means that styles applied to a parent element can affect the appearance of its descendant elements, unless overridden by more specific styles.
5. Box Model:- CSS treats each HTML element as a rectangular box, which consists of content, padding, border, and margin. The box model allows for precise control over the layout and spacing of elements on a web page.
6. Responsive Design:- CSS enables developers to create responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on factors such as screen width, orientation, and resolution.
7. Flexbox and Grid Layout:- CSS provides powerful layout mechanisms such as Flexbox and Grid Layout, which allow for complex and flexible arrangements of elements within a container. These layout techniques offer more control over positioning and alignment of elements.
8. Animations and Transitions:- CSS can be used to create animations and transitions to add interactivity and visual effects to web pages. Keyframe animations, transitions, and transformations enable smooth movement, fading, rotation, and scaling of elements.
9. Vendor Prefixes:- Some CSS properties require vendor prefixes to ensure compatibility with different web browsers. These prefixes are added to property names to support experimental or non-standard features until they are fully standardized.

Advantages of CSS:
------------------
1. Consistent Styling
2. Efficiency
3. Responsive Design
4. Browser Compatibility
5. Accessibility
6. Performance Optimization
7. Animation and Interactivity
